# Java / Spring consolidation exercices

## Step 1

A Maven skeleton project has been created with a main class and 2 model classes.

The goal of the first step is to fill the 3 classes by replacing comments by code.



## Step 2

The second step is to transform the project into a Spring project where a TeamController and a PlayerController must be created.

Theses controllers must be REST controllers and must enable user (unsing HTTP protocol) to :

- Create team/player
- List all teams
- List all team players
- Modify a team/player
- Delete a team/player



## Step 3

The third step is to add a persistence layer to the application in order to be able to save model classes in a database.

An H2 database may be used.
